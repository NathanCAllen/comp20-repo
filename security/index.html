    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Given Juliana Furgala's code and heroku for assignments 2 and 3, I was
        tasked with finding any and all flaws in the code.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>I found flaws first by thinking about issues that could plague any
        implementation of the project, and then by looking at her code directly
        to find specific flaws in her programs.</p>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    <p>I found several simple, but dangerous, security breaches in the client's
        code. One issue that is easy to exploit and harder to solve is cross
        site scripting (XSS). This allows a hacker to feed the database
        executable code that will run when the data is displayed as normal.
        Instead of showing the string itself, the web browser recognizes this as
        executable code, and will run it.<br>Another basic issue is that the
        server is accessible by anyone, not just people using the web page
        provided. This allows people to say they are at a certain location, even
        if they are not in that location. This can be used to the detriment of
        the service, as hackers can insert an infinity of random, falsified
        passengers.<br>A final flaw in the client's code comes from the
        simplicity of a set list of vehicle usernames. If a hacker could get
        ahold of this list, they could pretend to be a driver and log in at
        various locations, similar to the above point. However, this is
        significantly more malicious. Logging in as a vehicle shows the full
        list of passengers, including location. This would allow a hacker to
        find passengers, then ping the server again saying that there is a
        vehicle nearby, allowing them to pick up the passengers themselves.</p>
    <h2>Issues Found:</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>The structure of the client's program allows someone to set their
            username as HTML code that will be run when the page is loaded.</li>
    </ul></p>
