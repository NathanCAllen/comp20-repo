    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Given Juliana Furgala's code and heroku for assignments 2 and 3, I was
        tasked with finding any and all flaws in the code.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>I found flaws first by thinking about issues that could plague any
        implementation of the project, and then by looking at her code directly
        to find specific flaws in her programs.</p>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    <p>I found several simple, but dangerous, security breaches in the student's
        code. One issue that is easy to exploit and harder to solve is cross
        site scripting (XSS). This allows a hacker to feed the database
        executable code that will run when the data is displayed as normal.
        Instead of showing the string itself, the web browser recognizes this as
        executable code, and will run it.<br>Another basic issue is that the
        server is accessible by anyone, not just people using the web page
        provided. This allows people to say they are at a certain location, even
        if they are not in that location. This can be used to the detriment of
        the service, as hackers can insert an infinity of random, falsified
        passengers.<br>A final flaw in the student's code comes from the
        simplicity of a set list of vehicle usernames. If a hacker could get
        ahold of this list, they could pretend to be a driver and log in at
        various locations, similar to the above point. However, this is
        significantly more malicious. Logging in as a vehicle shows the full
        list of passengers, including location. This would allow a hacker to
        find passengers, then ping the server again saying that there is a
        vehicle nearby, allowing them to pick up the passengers themselves.</p>
    <h2>Issues Found:</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>The structure of the student's program allows someone to set their
            username as HTML code that will be run when the page is loaded. For
            example, if one were to set their username to a script tag including
            Javascript code, it would run that code. In testing the student's
            page, I made the page run smoe Javascript text that caused a
            popup window that could bring the user to a different page. While
            this problem is avoidable, I also included other examples of XSS,
            including style code that turned the screen black and a picture.
            These hacks mostly affected the passenger page. The severity of this
            issue varies; while displaying a picture does not break the app,
            malicious CSS, as described above, can render the page
            unreadable, and Javascript has the potential to wreak havoc on
            unsuspecting users. I knew this issue would exist because, as
            specified in a3, the student did not remove non-letter characters.
            This problem can be fixed by removing non-letter-or-number
            characters from usernames as they come in to the server.<br>

                image." height=450></li><br>
        <li>Because of the simplicity of the login system (just a three-variable
            query string), one does not need to be one the website created in a2
            to log in to the system. Using curl, one can artificially login,
            providing a fake username and coordinates. This is an issue found in
            the server, as it is there that the login is specified. The
            severity of this issue is rather high; while it seems that it only
            provides a slight annoyance to the drivers, it could make it
            impossible for the drivers to find real passengers, rendering the
            service unusable. This problem can only be sovled by strengthening
            the login system to prevent bots from spamming the service.
