Here you'll find all my labs, assignments, and projects for the course.
I liked the annotation lab the most, because it was a fun way to learn Javascript.
I have developped a stronger understanding of how the web works, and how to build in it.
The most important thing I learned in this course is HTML, as I have been able to market myself with it and I am more able to understand how websites work.
I would like to learn more about using JQuery to do simple animations.
